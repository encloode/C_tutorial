The assignments are due in a week.

1,Write a C program segment to display the index of the smallest and the largest
numbers in an array x of 20 integers.
let x have the follwing values..7,8,5,6,9,11,12,14,20,21,4,2,1,13,16,19,0,45,3,8.
the answer should be 17.

2.Write a C function called reverse that takes an array named x as an input
parameter and an array named y as an output parameter. A third function
parameter is n , the number of values in x . The function should copy the integers
in x into y but in reverse order (i.e., y[0] gets x[n - 1], . . . y[n - 1]
gets x[0] ).

3.Write a program segment to display the sum of the values in each row of a 5 × 3
type double array named table . How many row sums will be displayed? How
many elements are included in each sum?
